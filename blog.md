# Static and Dynamic Websites
This week I learned about the difference between a static and a dynamic website. Static sites are simple, usually made in only HTML or basic Javascript. They are quick, cheap, and easy to make. They do not change based on the user and if they have any interactivity, it is client-side. Dynamic websites on the other hand are generally used for more complex sites. They can be created in other languages along with HTML or Javascript. They can offer a more interactive and personalized experience for the user. These sites often are not free and they take time and effort to set up. Amazon is an example of a dynamic site.

This site, tvfilmbookreview, on the other hand, is an example of a static site. Any changes made to it are made in the source code and anyone who visits it will get the same experience. Despite being simpler, there are a few things that I have learned so far that I have applied here. First of all, I have used several different text format ideas such as headers and bullets. I have also included embedded links to different pages (the main page and this blog page). I plan on finding ways to use other things that I learn as well.
