# Static and Dynamic Websites
This week I learned about the difference between a static and a dynamic website. Static sites are simple, usually made in only HTML or basic Javascript. They are quick, cheap, and easy to make. They do not change based on the user and if they have any interactivity, it is client-side. Dynamic websites on the other hand are generally used for more complex sites. They can be created in other languages along with HTML or Javascript. They can offer a more interactive and personalized experience for the user. These sites often are not free and they take time and effort to set up. Amazon is an example of a dynamic site.

This site, tvfilmbookreview, on the other hand, is an example of a static site. Any changes made to it are made in the source code and anyone who visits it will get the same experience. Despite being simpler, there are a few things that I have learned so far that I have applied here. First of all, I have used several different text format ideas such as headers and bullets. I have also included embedded links to different pages (the main page and this blog page). I plan on finding ways to use other things that I learn as well.

# The History and Current State of Content Management Systems 
## Introduction
Business is not what it used to be. Since the introduction of the Internet and its rise in popularity, more and more businesses have been conducting their practice online. It makes sense. The Internet is an avenue to make your good or service available to anyone. Or at least to advertise it. With the realization that the Internet was the future, more time and money was spent on streamlining the process of bringing content to consumers. In 2020, it is more surprising for a business not to have an online presence than it is to have one. Web content can support several different vital business ideas. In this blog post I will be describing some of these business ideas and specific events involving them.
## Personalization
Personalization is fairly self-explanatory. If you have ever searched something online only to find a Facebook ad the next day with similar content, you understand that businesses try to collect data to tailor content to you. They use information you give them to target you with specific content. A less predatory example of personalization is the company Flipboard. They compile news from many sources and personalize it to fit what you want to see. When you first use their app, they ask you what types of subjects and content you are interested in. After that they tailor your Flipboard news feed to show you what types of stories and articles you want to see. Flipboard is an example of a profile-based personalization company. Other types of personalization are behavior-based and campaign-based. Behavior-based involves using previous behavior to predict future behavior. Facebook and other predatory companies tend to use this type of personalization. Campaign-based is when certain content is shown to people who meet some criteria. Along with personalization, websites will keep the surrounding format consistent. This means that they will have the same text format, color scheme, background, branding, etc.
## Advanced Websites
Advanced websites show why content management systems are necessary. On a website with a lot of content and pages, more and more problems start to appear without a CMS. It becomes exponentially more difficult to try to keep a consistent style to the pages and the time to correct mistakes becomes great. A CMS can alleviate a lot of the burden. It can offer a format and certain options to make the site consistent. It can also provide templates and other design options that make it easy for laymen to create pages themselves without much training.
## Multiple Publications
Before content management systems were invented, creating and publishing the same content across different formats was timely and inefficient. The work practically had to be done twice in most cases. Take books for example. In most cases books were written and then someone had to transcribe the text and format it again before publishing it online. Content management systems more or less fixed this issue. With CMSs, publications can be simultaneous. If content is created in such a way that it is independent of format, it can be made to fit different contexts much easier than if it was originally created specifically for one such context.
## E-Commerce
E-commerce is perhaps the most recognizable business aspect improved or created by the emergence of content management systems. As soon as the world wide web was able to handle it, e-commerce began to take over online business. Businesses started creating online catalogs as an avenue to conduct business. These catalogs connected with older systems to create a similar experience to physical stores. A catalog system is basically a database that collects, manages, and publishes information. It also can make monetary transactions.  Other considerations in e-commerce were how the site interacted with existing systems and the process customers went through to make a transaction on the site.
## Knowledge Management
Knowledge management and content management are similar yet different. While content management is about “collection and distribution”, knowledge management is about “discovery and synthesis”. (Boiko) Knowledge management without proper content management can lead to a whole lot of data without a way to parse it. Applying a content management system after knowledge management can lead to a much more usable and user-friendly system. A company that has done years of research and gathered terabytes of data would want a way to efficiently index and search this data once it becomes large enough.
## Online Communities
Online communities have also become common after the creation of content management systems. An online community is similar to an audience in that all participants have something in common. They differ in that there is intercommunication between the members of the community. The interactions aren’t between a speaker and audience members, but between any subgroup of the community to another subgroup. An example of an online community system is Reddit. On that site you are able to find a community for nearly any subject and there is a system to discuss the subject with others that hold the same interest.
## Conclusion
There are many aspects of business that have been affected by the coming of content management systems. The aforementioned are the main parts but there are certainly others. Each of these parts need the capacities of a CMS to function at their maximum potential.
