# Welcome to TV, Film, and Book Review by Logan Rigdon

On this site I will periodically post my thoughts and ratings of different stories that I have recently watched or read.

I will be using a rating system of -100 to 100. A rating of 0 would mean that the story is perfectly average, while a negative 100 or positive 100 would mean that it is among the worst or best media I've experienced. My reviews will be based on a combination of how much I personally enjoyed it and how objectively good I thought it was.

There are several categories I will be using to judge TV shows and Movies. Each of these categories will receive an individual rating. The categories are as follows:
- Premise
- Plot
- Characters
- Themes
- Immediate Interest
- Long-Term Interest
- Soundtrack
- Acting
- Technical Aspects
- Cinematography

For books the categories will look something like:
- Premise
- Plot
- Characters
- Themes
- Immediate Interest
- Long-Term Interest
- Prose
